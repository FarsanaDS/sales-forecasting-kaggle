📊 Sales Forecasting - Kaggle Competition

🚀 Predicting future sales using advanced machine learning techniques! This project was built for a Kaggle competition, applying XGBoost and LightGBM to forecast sales.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Sales forecasting is a critical problem in retail. This project uses historical sales data along with feature engineering and machine learning models to predict future sales.

- Dataset: Provided in the Kaggle competition.
- Goal: Predict the sales_hat (future sales) for given items.
- Challenge: Handling missing data, feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning to improving accuracy.

## 📂 Dataset Details

The dataset includes sales transactions with columns like:
- id: Unique identifier for the item and date.
- date: Transaction date.
- sales: Number of units sold.
- sell_price_main: Selling price of the item.
- discounts: Various types of discounts applied.
- holidays: Whether the date is a holiday or not.

- Train Set: sales_train.csv (4M+ rows)
- Test Set: sales_test.csv (No sales column, to be predicted)

## 🛠 Techniques Used

⿡ Feature Engineering

- Date Features: Extracted year, month, day, weekday, is_weekend, quarter
- Lag Features: sales_lag_1, sales_lag_7, sales_lag_30 (previous sales history)
- Rolling Statistics: sales_ma_7, sales_ma_30 (moving averages)
- Exponential Moving Average (EMA): sales_ema_7, sales_ema_30
- Price Features: price_change, price_elasticity
- Stock Availability: is_out_of_stock, availability
- Discount Effects: total_discount, discount_rate, discount_per_order

⿢ Model Training

- XGBoost with Hyperparameter Tuning (RandomizedSearchCV)
- LightGBM for Speed and Performance

⿣ Hyperparameter Tuning
Used RandomizedSearchCV to optimize:
n_estimators
max_depth
learning_rate
subsample
colsample_bytree
gamma, reg_alpha, reg_lambda

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Try LSTMs or Transformers for time-series forecasting.
- Use external data sources like economic indicators.
- Apply feature selection for reducing dimensionality.
